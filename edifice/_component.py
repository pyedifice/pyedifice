class Reference(object):
    """Reference to a :class:`Component` to allow imperative modifications.

    While Edifice is a declarative library and tries to abstract away the need to issue
    imperative commands to widgets,
    this is not always possible, either due to limitations with the underlying backened,
    or because some feature implemented by the backend is not yet supported by the declarative layer.
    In these cases, you might need to issue imperative commands to the underlying widgets and components,
    and :class:`Reference` gives you a handle to the currently rendered :class:`Component`.

    Consider the following code::

        class MyComp(Component):
            def __init__(self):
                self.ref = None

            def issue_command(self, e):
                self.ref.issue_command()

            def render(self):
                self.ref = AnotherComponent(on_click=self.issue_command)
                return self.ref

    This code is **incorrect** since the component returned by render is not necessarily the Component rendered on Screen,
    since the old component (with all its state) will be reused when possible.
    The right way of solving the problem is via references::

        class MyComp(Component):
            def __init__(self):
                self.ref = Reference()

            def issue_command(self, e):
                self.ref().issue_command()

            def render(self):
                return AnotherComponent(on_click=self.issue_command).register_ref(self.ref)

    Under the hood, :code:`register_ref` registers the :class:`Reference` object
    to the component returned by the :code:`render` function.
    While rendering, Edifice will examine all requested references and attaches
    them to the correct :class:`Component`.

    Initially, a :class:`Reference` object will point to :code:`None`.
    After the first render, they will point to the rendered :class:`Component`.
    When the rendered component dismounts, the reference will once again
    point to :code:`None`.
    You may assume that :class:`Reference` is valid whenever it is
    not :code:`None`.
    :class:`Reference` will evaluate false if the underlying value is :code:`None`.

    :class:`Reference` can be dereferenced by calling it. An idiomatic way of using references is::

        if ref:
            ref().do_something()

    If you want to access the Qt widget underlying a base component,
    you can use the :code:`underlying` attribute of the component::

        class MyComp(Component):
            def __init__(self):
                self.ref = Reference()

            def did_render(self):
                if self.ref:
                    self.ref().underlying.setText("Hi")

            def render(self):
                return Label("Hi").register_ref(self.ref)
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self._value = None

    def __bool__(self):
        return self._value is not None

    def __hash__(self):
        return id(self)

    def __call__(self):
        return self._value


class Component(object):
    """The base class for Edifice Components.

    A :class:`Component` is a stateful container wrapping a stateless :code:`render` function.
    Components have both internal and external properties.

    The external properties, **props**, are passed into the :class:`Component` by another
    :class:`Component`’s render function through the constructor. These values are owned
    by the external caller and should not be modified by this :class:`Component`.
    They may be accessed via the field props :code:`self.props`, which is a :class:`PropsDict`.
    A :class:`PropsDict` allows iteration, get item ( :code:`self.props["value"]` ), and get attribute
    ( :code:`self.props.value` ), but not set item or set attribute. This limitation
    is set to protect the user from accidentally modifying props, which may cause
    bugs. (Note though that a mutable prop, e.g. a list, can still be modified;
    be careful not to do so)

    The internal properties, the **state**, belong to this Component, and may be
    used to keep track of internal state. You may set the state as
    attributes of the :class:`Component` object, for instance :code:`self.my_state`.
    You can initialize the state as usual in the constructor
    (e.g. :code:`self.my_state = {"a": 1}` ),
    and the state persists so long as the :class:`Component` is still mounted.

    In most cases, changes in state would ideally trigger a rerender.
    There are two ways to ensure this.
    First, you may use the set_state function to set the state::

        self.set_state(mystate=1, myotherstate=2)

    You may also use the self.render_changes() context manager::

        with self.render_changes():
            self.mystate = 1
            self.myotherstate = 2

    When the context manager exits, a state change will be triggered.
    The :code:`render_changes()` context manager also ensures that all state changes
    happen atomically: if an exception occurs inside the context manager,
    all changes will be unwound. This helps ensure consistency in the
    :class:`Component`’s state.

    Note if you set :class:`self.mystate = 1` outside
    the :code:`render_changes()` context manager,
    this change will not trigger a re-render. This might be occasionally useful
    but usually is unintended.

    The main function of :class:`Component` is :code:`render`, which should return the subcomponents
    of this component. These may be your own higher-level components as well as
    the core :class:`Component` s, such as
    :class:`Label`, :class:`Button`, and :class:`View`.
    :class:`Component` s may be composed in a tree like fashion:
    one special prop is children, which will always be defined (defaults to an
    empty list).
    To better enable the visualization of the tree-structure of a :class:`Component`
    in the code,
    the :code:`call` method of a :class:`Component` has been overriden to set the arguments
    of the call as children of the component.
    This allows you to write tree-like code remniscent of HTML::

        View(layout="column")(
            View(layout="row")(
                Label("Username: "),
                TextInput()
            ),
            View(layout="row")(
                Label("Email: "),
                TextInput()
            ),
        )

    The :code:`render` function is called when
    :code:`self.should_update(newprops, newstate)`
    returns :code:`True`. This function is called when the props change (as set by the
    render function of this component) or when the state changes (when
    using :code:`set_state` or :code:`render_changes()`). By default, all changes
    in :code:`newprops`
    and :code:`newstate` will trigger a re-render.

    When the component is rendered,
    the :code:`render` function is called. This output is then compared against the output
    of the previous render (if that exists). The two renders are diffed,
    and on certain conditions, the :class:`Component` objects from the previous render
    are maintained and updated with new props.

    Two :class:`Component` s belonging to different classes will always be re-rendered,
    and :class:`Component` s belonging to the same class are assumed to be the same
    and thus maintained (preserving the old state).

    When comparing a list of :class:`Component` s, the :class:`Component`’s
    :code:`_key` attribute will
    be compared. :class:`Component` s with the same :code:`_key` and same class are assumed to be
    the same. You can set the key using the :code:`set_key` method, which returns the component
    to allow for chaining::

        View(layout="row")(
            MyComponent("Hello").set_key("hello"),
            MyComponent("World").set_key("world"),
        )

    If the :code:`_key` is not provided, the diff algorithm will assign automatic keys
    based on index, which could result in subpar performance due to unnecessary rerenders.
    To ensure control over the rerender process, it is recommended to :code:`set_key`
    whenever you have a list of children.

    only this component and (possibly) its children will be re-rendered.
    If you don't use the decorator, the returned components are directly attached to the
    Component that called the function, and so any re-renders will have to start from that level.

    Args:
        f: the function to wrap. Its first argument must be self, and children must be one of its parameters.
    Returns:
        Component class.

    This decorator will record all arguments (both vector and keyword arguments)
    of the :code:`__init__` function as belonging to the props of the component.
    It will call
    :func:`Component.register_props <edifice.Component.register_props>` to
    store these arguments in the
    props field of the :class:`Component`.

    Arguments that begin with an underscore will be ignored.

    Example::

        class MyComponent(Component):

            @register_props
            def __init__(self, a, b=2, c="xyz", _d=None):

                    Label(self.props.c),
                )

    :code:`MyComponent(5, c="w")` will then have
    :code:`props.a=5`, :code:`props.b=2`, and :code:`props.c="w"`.
    :code:`props._d` is undefined.

        f: the :code:`__init__` function of a :class:`Component` subclass
