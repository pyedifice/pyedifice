Edifice is a Python library for building declarative application user interfaces.

- Modern **declarative** UI paradigm from web development.
- **100% Python** application development, no language inter-op.
- A **native** desktop app instead of a bundled web browser.
- Fast iteration via **hot-reloading**.

This modern declarative UI paradigm is also known as
“`The Elm Architecture <https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/>`_,”
or “`Model-View-Update <https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update>`_.”

Edifice uses `PySide6 <https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/>`_
or `PyQt6 <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/introduction.html>`_
as a backend. So Edifice is like
`React <https://react.dev/>`_, but with
Python instead of JavaScript, and `Qt Widgets <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwidgets-index.html>`_
instead of the HTML DOM.
If you have experience with React,
you will find Edifice very easy to pick up.

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is via the :doc:`tutorial`.
To understand the core conception behind Edifice,
see :doc:`edifice`.

Why Edifice?
------------

**Declarative**

The premise of Edifice is that
GUI designers should only need to worry about *what* is rendered on the screen,
not *how* the content is rendered.

Most existing GUI libraries in Python, such as Tkinter and Qt, operate imperatively.
To create a dynamic application using these libraries,
you must not only think about *what* to display to the user given state changes,
but also *how* to issue the commands to achieve the desired display.

Edifice allows you to declare *what* should be rendered given the current state,
leaving the *how* to the library.

User interactions update the state, and state changes update the GUI.
You only need to specify what is to be displayed given the current state and how
user interactions modify this state.

With Edifice you write code like:

.. code-block:: python

    number, set_number = use_state(0)

    with View():
        Button("Add 5", on_click=lambda event: set_number(number+5))
        Label(str(number))

and get the expected result: the GUI always displays
a button and a label displaying the current value of :code:`number`.
Clicking the button adds 5 to the :code:`number`,
and Edifice will handle updating the GUI.

**Developer Tools**

Declarative UIs are also easier for developer tools to work with.
Edifice provides two key features to make development easier:

- Dynamic hot-reloading of changed source code.
- Element inspector.

See :doc:`developer_tools` for more details.

**Edifice vs. QML**

`QML <https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/overviews/qmlapplications.html>`_ is Qt’s declarative GUI framework for Qt.
Edifice differs from QML in these aspects:

- Edifice programs are written purely in Python, whereas QML programs are written
  in Python + a special QML language + JavaScript.
- Because Edifice interfaces are built in Python code, binding the code to the declared UI is much more straightforward.
- Edifice makes it easy to create dynamic applications. It's easy to create, shuffle, and destroy widgets
  because the interface is written in Python code. QML assumes a much more static interface.

An analogy is, QML is like HTML + JavaScript, whereas Edifice is like React.js.
While QML and HTML are both declarative UI frameworks,
they require imperative logic to add dynamism.
Edifice and React allow fully dynamic applications to be specified declaratively.

**Extendable**

Edifice is still currently under development, and some Qt widgets/functionality are not supported.
However, it is easy to interface with Qt, either :ref:`incorporating a Qt Widget<custom_widget>` into an Edifice component,
:doc:`use Qt commands directly<stubs/edifice.Reference>` with an existing Edifice component,
or :doc:`incorporating Edifice components<stubs/stubs/edifice.App.export_widgets>` in a Qt application.
