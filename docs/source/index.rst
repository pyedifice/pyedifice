Edifice is a Python library for building declarative application user interfaces.

- Modern **declarative** UI paradigm from web development.
- **100% Python** application development, no language inter-op.
- A **native** desktop app instead of a bundled web browser.
- Fast iteration via **hot reloading**.

This modern declarative UI paradigm is also known as
“`Model-View-Update <https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update>`_,”
or “`The Elm Architecture <https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/>`_.”

Edifice uses `PySide6 <https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/>`_
or `PyQt6 <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/introduction.html>`_
as a backend. So Edifice is like
`React <https://react.dev/>`_, but with
Python instead of JavaScript, and `Qt Widgets <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwidgets-index.html>`_
instead of the HTML DOM.
If you have experience with React,
you will find Edifice very easy to pick up.

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is via the :doc:`tutorial`.
To understand the core conception behind Edifice,
see :doc:`edifice`.

Here are a few simple examples to get you started:

Simple Forms
############

The Form component in the Edifice library make it really easy to create a simple Form.
Data in a dictionary are mapped to form elements according to the data type:
strings to TextInput, bools to Checkbox, etc.
The example below shows how you can collect information from the user in a Dialog.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Form Dialog

    import datetime
    import edifice
    from edifice.components.forms import FormDialog

    # StateManagers are key-value stores that UI components can bind to reactively:
    # a change in the StateManager will refresh all subscribed UI components
    fields = edifice.StateManager({
        "Name": "", # text input
        "Age": 20,  # text input with validation
        "Date": datetime.date(2021, 2, 1), # 3 dropdowns
        "Country": ("USA", ["USA", "UK", "France", "Japan"]), # dropdown
        "agreed": True, # checkbox
    })

    edifice.App(FormDialog(fields)).start()

    print(fields["Name"])

A Stateful Element
####################

A component can maintain internal state, stored as attributes of the component.
When this state is changed using the :code:`set_state` method,
the component will be re-rendered using the provided :code:`render` function.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Timer component

    import edifice

    class Timer(edifice.Element):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.seconds = 0
            self.timer = edifice.Timer(lambda: self.set_state(seconds=self.seconds+1))

        def did_mount(self):
            self.timer.start(1000)

        def render(self):
            return edifice.Label(self.seconds, style={"width": 80, "height": 30, "font-size": 20})

    edifice.App(Timer()).start()

An Application
##############

Elements can be composed to create composite components.
By making components modular, you can reuse them in your application and across applications.


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Todo App

    import datetime
    import edifice
    from edifice import Button, Label, TextInput, ScrollView, View

    class TodoApp(edifice.Element):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.items = []
            self.text = ""

        def render(self):
            return View(style={"margin": 10})(
                Label("TODO"),
                TodoList(items=self.items),
                View(layout="row")(
                    Label("What needs to be done?"),
                    TextInput(self.text,
                              on_change=lambda text:self.set_state(text=text)),
                    Button(f"Add #{len(self.items)+1}",
                           on_click=self.add_item)
                )
            )

        def add_item(self, e):
            if not self.text:
                return
            new_item = dict(text=self.text, id=datetime.datetime.now())
            self.set_state(items=self.items + [new_item])

    class TodoList(edifice.Element):
        def __init__(self, items):
            self.register_props({
                "items": items,
            })

        def render(self):
            return ScrollView()(
                *[Label(f"* {item['text']}").set_key(item['id'])
                  for item in self.props.items]
            )

    edifice.App(TodoApp()).start()



Why Edifice?
------------

The premise of Edifice is that
GUI designers should only need to worry about *what* is rendered on the screen,
not *how* the content is rendered.
Most existing GUI libraries in Python, such as Tkinter and Qt, operate imperatively.
To create a dynamic application using these libraries,
you must not only think about what to display to the user given state changes,
but also how to issue the commands to achieve the desired effect.

Edifice allows you to describe what should be rendered given the current state,
leaving the how to the library.
User interactions update the state, and state changes update the GUI.
You only need to specify what is to be displayed given the current state and how
user interactions modify this state.
Edifice will ensure that
the displayed widgets always correspond to the internal state.
For example, you can write:

.. code-block:: python

    View(layout="row")(
        Button("Add 5", on_click=lambda:self.set_state(data=self.number + 5)),
        Label(self.number)
    )

and get the expected result: the GUI always displays
a button and a label displaying the current value of self.number.
Clicking the button adds 5 to the number,
and Edifice will handle updating the GUI.

Edifice is designed to make GUI applications easier for humans to reason about.
Thus, the displayed GUI always reflect the internal state,
even if an exception occurs part way through rendering ---
in that case, the state changes are unwound,
the display is unchanged,
and the exception is re-raised for the application to handle.
You can specify a batch of state changes in a transaction,
so that either all changes happen or none of them happens.
There is no in-between state for you to worry about.

Declarative UIs are also easier for developer tools to work with.
Edifice provides two key features to make development easier:

- Dynamic reloading of changed source code. This is especially useful for tweaking the looks of your application, allowing you to test if the margin should be 10px or 15px instantly without closing the app, reopening it, and waiting for everything to load.
- Element inspector. Similar to the Inspect Elements tool of a browser, the component inspector will show you all Elements in your application along with the props and state, allowing you to examine the internal state of your complex component without writing a million print statements.
  Since the UI is specified as a (pure) function of state, the state you see completely describes your application,
  and you can even do things like rewinding to a previous state.

QML is another declarative GUI framework for Qt. Edifice differs from QML in these aspects:

- Edifice interfaces are created purely in Python, whereas QML is written using a custom markup language.
- Because Edifice interfaces are built in Python code, binding Python code to the declared UI is much more straightforward.
- Edifice makes it easy to create dynamic applications. It's easy to create, shuffle, and destroy widgets because the interface is written in Python code. QML assumes a much more static interface.

An analogy is, QML is like HTML + JavaScript, whereas Edifice is like React.js.
While QML and HTML are both declarative UI frameworks,
they require imperative logic to add dynamism.
Edifice and React allow fully dynamic applications to be specified declaratively.

Edifice is still currently under development, and some Qt widgets/functionality are not supported.
However, it is easy to interface with Qt, either :ref:`incorporating a Qt Widget<custom_widget>` into an Edifice component,
:doc:`use Qt commands directly<stubs/edifice.Reference>` with an existing Edifice component,
or :doc:`incorporating Edifice components<stubs/stubs/edifice.App.export_widgets>` in a Qt application.
