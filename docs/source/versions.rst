v1.5.0
------
Released: 2024-09-20

* New Base Element :class:`WindowPopView`.


v1.4.0
------
Released: 2024-09-13

* Hook :func:`use_state` new feature **initializer function**.


v1.3.0
------
Released: 2024-09-12

* New Hook :func:`use_hover`.


v1.2.0
------
Released: 2024-09-10

* :class:`Window` new prop :code:`on_open`.
* New utility functions :func:`utilities.theme_is_light`,
  :func:`utilities.palette_edifice_light`, :func:`utilities.palette_edifice_dark`.
* Delete deprecated method :code:`App.set_stylesheet`.


v1.1.0
------
Released: 2024-09-05

* :class:`SpinInput` new prop :code:`single_step`.


v1.0.0
------
Released: 2024-08-27

The API and features are pretty stable and reliable now, so this is
version 1.


v0.8.1
------
Released: 2024-08-27

* Bugfix for the Harmonic Oscillator example.
* Change Sphinx theme to :code:`pydata-sphinx-theme` for documentation.


v0.8.0
------
Released: 2024-07-27

* New Element: :class:`NumpyImage<extra.NumpyImage>`.

* Inspector improvements and debugging.

* :class:`Slider` :code:`on_change` event handler prop can be a future.

* :code:`children` prop type changed to :code:`tuple[Element, ...]`.

  This should get rid of the lint warnings about the argument
  default :code:`[]` value.

* Deprecate :code:`View`, :code:`ScrollView`.

  Replace :code:`View` with:
    - :class:`HBoxView`
    - :class:`VBoxView`
    - :class:`FixView`

  Replace :code:`ScrollView` with:
    - :class:`HScrollView`
    - :class:`VScrollView`
    - :class:`FixScrollView`

We are eliminating the :code:`layout= "row" | "column" | "none"` prop because it
never worked as a prop. If the value of the layout prop was
changed then the layout of the View would not change. To render a
:code:`View(layout="row")` and then replace it with a
:code:`View(layout="column")`, it was necessary to add
unique :code:`set_key()` so that the reconciliation algorithm would recognize
that the Views needed to be destroyed and recreated. This behavior was
buggy and surprising and now it’s gone.

:class:`ButtonView` is now a subclass of :class:`HBoxView`.
For column layout, put a :class:`VBoxView` inside the :class:`ButtonView`.

We have added functions :func:`View`, :func:`ScrollView` which behave like the
old elements of the same name, so that old code will still work, probably.
These functions have deprecation warnings at the type level and at runtime,
and they will be removed in the future.

.. _v0.7.4:

v0.7.4
------
Released: 2024-06-14

  and :func:`child_place`.

The state of :class:`RadioButton` and :class:`CheckBox` is now dependent only

of the parent widget, and only depends on how the :code:`checked` prop
is calculated.

.. _v0.2.0:

v0.2.0
------
Released: 2023-11-13

This version has a lot of breaking changes. We have done essentially the same
upgrade that React.js did when they upgraded to function components and Hooks
in version 16.8.

* :func:`component` render function decorator instead of :code:`Component`
  subclass. Renamed old :code:`Component` to :class:`Element`.
  Deprecated the API for users to inherit from :code:`Element`.
  Privatized most of the :code:`Element` API.

* :doc:`Hooks<hooks>` instead of :code:`StateValue` and :code:`StateManager`,
  which are deprecated.

* New :code:`with` context manager syntax for declaring children instead of the
  Element :code:`__call__` syntax for declaring children.

* Moved :class:`ButtonView`, :class:`FlowView`, :code:`ImageAspect`,
  :class:`TableGridView` to Base Elements.

* Deprecated all Higher-level Components.

* Other miscellaneous improvements.

The old API for writing Elements
by inheriting from the :code:`Component` class, overriding the :code:`render()`
function, and calling :code:`self.set_state()` has has been deprecated.

A new API
for writing Elements with the :func:`component` decorator and :doc:`hooks` has replaced the
old API. Most of the old API machinery still exists, but has been hidden
from the public API. If you want to upgrade
old code to this version but don’t want to completely re-write for the new
API, then you can make a few changes and run your old code.

1. :code:`Component` has been renamed to :class:`Element`.
2. The :class:`Element` :code:`render()` function has been renamed to
   :code:`_render_element()`. Most other methods of :class:`Element` have
   also been renamed with a prefix underscore. The method :code:`set_state()`
   is now :code:`_set_state()`.
3. The :code:`StateValue` and :code:`StateManager` can be imported from module
   :code:`edifice.state`.
